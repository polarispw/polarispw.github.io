Iâ€™m a senior student at Northeastern University, with a major in Artificial Intelligence, and will graduate in 2023.

I am especially intrigued by the NLP field. Throughout my previous courses and projects, I have focused on language modeling. In my future studies, I would like to explore fields like NLP+X, enabling the model to be used efficiently and conveniently in more scenarios.

I am also looking for a Phd position in 2024 fall.
